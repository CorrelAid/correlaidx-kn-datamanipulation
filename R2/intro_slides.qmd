# Welcome

Welcome to the follow-up to the "Intro to R"! If you see this you have managed to download the files from GitHub, which already makes you smarter than tolly500:

If you haven't already:

1. Install R:
  - [Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
  - [MacOS](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) (make sure you select the right one based on whether you have an "old" intel mac or a new Apple silicon (M1/M2) mac)
  - Linux: from package manager (probably either `R` or `r-base`)

2. Install RStudio [from the official website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

3. Install packages: 

  - once you are inside RStudio, head to the console (the little window that says "console"), enter `install.packages(c("tidyverse", "gapminder", "here", "markdown", "rmarkdown"))` and hit Enter.
  - Enjoy epic hacker moment
  
4. Make yourself feel at home: If you're done early, under Tools > Global Options > Appearance you can change the theme etc

# Course outline

* **Day 1:** Data Manipulation
  - Intro to the tidyverse (`dplyr`-verbs etc.)
  - Joining & data wrangling
  - Basic modelling & presentation of results

* **Day 2:** Data Visualization
  - `ggplot2`
  - *Bonus:* maps with `sf`, interactive visualization with `plotly`, animations with `gganimate`.

# Tidyverse

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

*"The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures."*

You can install all packages that belong to the tidyverse with:

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

# Tidyverse vs. base R

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

In this course we teach the tidyverse because...

* `tidyverse`-esque code usually more readable
* Easier to pick up on for beginners
* Coherent
* Often [faster](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2022/10/efficiency-comparison-of-dplyr-and-tidyr-functions-vs-base-r/) than base R
