# Welcome

Welcome to the follow-up to the "Intro to R"! If you see this you have managed to download the files from GitHub, which already makes you smarter than tolly500:

::: {.column width="60%"}

::: {style="font-size: 60%;"}

If you haven't already:

1. Install R:
  - [Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
  - [MacOS](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) (make sure you select the right one based on whether you have an "old" intel mac or a new Apple silicon (M1/M2) mac)
  - Linux: from package manager (probably either `R` or `r-base`)

2. Install RStudio [from the official website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

3. Install packages: 

  - once you are inside RStudio, head to the console (the little window that says "console"), enter `install.packages(c("tidyverse", "gapminder", "here", "markdown", "rmarkdown"))` and hit Enter.
  - Enjoy epic hacker moment
  
4. Make yourself feel at home: If you're done early, under Tools > Global Options > Appearance you can change the theme etc

# Tidy data

Our goal for today is to learn the basic toolset for tidy data, including common manipulations & visualizations.

Tomorrow we will go beyond and discuss how to make untidy datasets tidy.

* This course is unfortunately *very* condensed, but please feel free to still ask questions if you don't understand something or would like to know something that was not mentioned!
