# The data analysis process

![The data analysis process](../assets/process.png)

So far, you have (hopefully) looked at how to import data, and how to interact with it; maybe done some basic tidying. We now want to do some more tidying, and move into the circle of exploring, transforming, and analyzing your data.

First, we would like to talk about the basics of visualizing data, one because it's one of the most fun things, and two because visualizations can help you explore your data and learn more about it, which you can then use to clean, transform and analyze it!

# Visualizations with `ggplot2`:

## Grammar of graphics

A heuristic for thinking about statistical visualizations. What is a visualization?

> A *mapping* of *data* to *aesthetic attributes* (color, shape, size...) of *geometric objects* (points, lines, bars...)

## How it translates to code

We work in layers: just calling `ggplot` creates an empty base layer:

```{r}
ggplot()
```

Adding data & mappings for the axes:

```{r}
ggplot(data = gm, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))
```

Adding "geometric objects" (`geom_*()`s) to represent data points (here: points):

```{r}
gm |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + # adding layers with "+"
  geom_point()
```

There are more attributes, like `color`:

```{r}
gm |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) + 
  geom_point()
```

* **Exercise:** Recreate the above plot, and map `size` to the countries' population (`pop`)! *Bonus:* Do you notice anything that could be problematic?

```{r}

```

If we set aesthetic attributes outside `aes()`, they take on static values. For example, `alpha` determines the opaqueness of objects:

```{r}
gm |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent, size = pop)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5)
```

Let's work on those labels; currently, legend labels for `pop` and axis labels for `gdpPercap` look... unfortunate. You can fix this using `scale_*`-layers and the `scales`-package:

```{r}
gm |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent, size = pop)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_size_continuous(labels = scales::label_comma()) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_currency())
```

We could also try projecting GDP on a logarithmic scale given its distribution (change normal `_continuous` scale to `_log10`:

```{r}
gm |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent, size = pop)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_size_continuous(labels = scales::label_comma()) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_currency())
```


You can also set labels for axis & legend using `labs()`:

```{r}
gm |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent, size = pop)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_size_continuous(labels = scales::label_comma()) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_currency()) +
  labs(
    title = "GDP & Life Expectancy", 
    subtitle = "...for countries from 5 continents",
    x = "GDP p.C.", 
    y = "Life Expectancy (Years)",
    color = "Continent", 
    size = "Population"
  )
```

`ggplot2` also has themes:

```{r}
gm |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent, size = pop)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_size_continuous(labels = scales::label_comma()) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_currency()) +
  labs(
    title = "GDP & Life Expectancy", 
    subtitle = "...for countries from 5 continents",
    x = "GDP p.C.", 
    y = "Life Expectancy (Years)",
    color = "Continent", 
    size = "Population"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Other `geom_*`s

Lines (`geom_line()`):

```{r}
gapminder |> 
  filter(country == "Germany") |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_line()
```

Bars (`geom_bar()` & `geom_col()` (= columns, aka easier to use bars)):

```{r}
gapminder |> 
  filter(country == "Germany") |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_col()
```

Violin- & Boxplots (`geom_violin()` & `geom_boxplot()`)

```{r}
gapminder |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, group = year)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Combining geoms

You can also just slap multiple geoms on top of each other (they will be drawn in the order they are specified in the code):

```{r}
gapminder |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, group = year)) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "grey") +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.3), alpha = 0.2)
```

For a more complicated example, consider our previous plot:

```{r}
gm |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent, size = pop)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_size_continuous(labels = scales::label_comma()) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_currency()) +
  labs(
    title = "GDP & Life Expectancy", 
    subtitle = "...for countries from 5 continents",
    x = "GDP p.C.", 
    y = "Life Expectancy (Years)",
    color = "Continent", 
    size = "Population"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

We can also overlay multiple geoms (they will be drawn in the order in which they are specified). Let's add a trend line. Be wary of which `aes()` belong to which geom:

```{r}
gm |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_line(stat = "smooth", method = stats::loess, linetype = "dashed", color = "grey", size = 1) +
  # ^ Alternatively, look into geom_smooth (can e.g. also display confidence interval)
  geom_point(aes(color = continent, size = pop), alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_size_continuous(labels = scales::label_comma()) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_comma()) +
  labs(
    title = "GDP & Life Expectancy", 
    subtitle = "...for countries from 5 continents",
    x = "GDP p.C.", 
    y = "Life Expectancy (Years)",
    color = "Continent", 
    size = "Population"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Or linear & by continent:

```{r}
gm |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) + 
  geom_line(stat = "smooth", method = stats::lm, linetype = "dashed", size = 1, alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_point(aes(size = pop), alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_size_continuous(labels = scales::label_comma()) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_comma()) +
  labs(
    title = "GDP & Life Expectancy", 
    subtitle = "...for countries from 5 continents",
    x = "GDP p.C.", 
    y = "Life Expectancy (Years)",
    color = "Continent", 
    size = "Population"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Wraps

Let's say you wanted to plot the distribution of life expectancy every year *by continent*. Would you have to `filter()` and make plots for all continents separately? There is of course a smarter way: we can "wrap" the plot by continent:

```{r}
gapminder |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, group = year, fill = continent)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~continent)
```

## Axes, scales & `theme()`-elements

All visual elements of the plot can be changed inside `theme()` (the ggplot2-internal syntax may seem a bit strange at first):

```{r}
# show "scales::comma_format()" & "scales::percent_format()"
gapminder |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, group = year, fill = continent)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~continent) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45), 
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )
```

# Color & fill scales

```{r}
gm |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent, size = pop)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "GDP & Life Expectancy", 
    subtitle = "...for countries from 5 continents",
    x = "GDP p.C.", 
    y = "Life Expectancy (Years)",
    color = "Continent", 
    size = "Population"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_viridis_d()
  # Or others:
  #scale_color_brewer(palette = "Accent")
```

If you are interested in visualizations, you can read up on color & fill scales and color theory for ggplot2 [here](https://ggplot2-book.org/scales-colour).

### Putting it all together

```{r}
gm |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent, size = pop)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "GDP & Life Expectancy", 
    subtitle = "...for countries from 5 continents, in 2007",
    x = "GDP p.C.", 
    y = "Life Expectancy (Years)",
    color = "Continent", 
    size = "Population",
    caption = "Data: Gapminder"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1)) +
  # ^ You can also change horizontal (hjust) and vertical (vjust) alignment!
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_currency()) +
  scale_size_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format())
```

# Exercise time

Load the ["Palmer's Penguins" data set](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/). Make visualizations to explore the data. For example, look at `bill_length_mm` and `bill_depth_mm` by `species` or `body_mass_g` by `species` and `sex`, or any other relationship!

```{r}
# install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(palmerpenguins)

penguins
```


# Bonus: Animations

```{r}
library(gganimate)
library(transformr)
library(gifski)
```

First we specify our animation. This is just a ggplot with a variable for transitioning (in our case: `year`), and some optional other parameters (like how to handle/ease transitions between frames):

```{r}
animation <- 
  
  # First the plot:
  
  gapminder |> # Notice we use gapminder (the data for all years)!
  
  # First we specify the basic plot to be drawn:
  
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_line(stat = "smooth", method = stats::lm, lty = "dashed", size = 1, color = "lightgrey") +
  geom_point(aes(color = continent, size = pop), alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "GDP & Life Expectancy", 
    # We change the subtitle to show the Years during the animation.
    # You can access the current frame (year) with `closest_state`
    subtitle = "Year: { closest_state }",
    x = "GDP p.C. (Log10)", 
    y = "Life Expectancy (Years)",
    color = "Continent", 
    size = "Population",
    caption = "Data: Gapminder"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_currency()) +
  scale_size_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format()) +
  
  # Then what variable to animate/transition on (and how to transition):
  
  transition_states(states = year, transition_length = 2, state_length = 1) +
  ease_aes() +
  exit_fade()
```

Then we animate it. You can use different backends & formats; here, we want to export to a GIF using `gifski`:

```{r}
animate(
  animation,
  duration = 8,
  fps = 30,
  width = 700,
  height = 500,
  renderer = gifski_renderer()
)
```

If you want to, you can save it:

```{r eval=FALSE}
anim_save("animation.gif") # saves the last animation by default
```
